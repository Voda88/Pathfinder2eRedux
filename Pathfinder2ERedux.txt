# Pathfinder 2E Redux ((Title))
This is a homebrew version of the core Pathfinder 2e ruleset, modified to create an experience with three design goals in mind: enabling more character fantasies, supporting narrative tension through gameplay adjustments and encouraging experimentation in character development. 
-
)

Pathfinder 2E Redux incorporates a number official variants, homebrew by other authors and homebrew by me. 

# Description of Design Goals ((+))

There are three major goals for this version. Listed below are each and the sources for materials to address these goals.

## Enabling more class fantasies ((+))

The core pathfinder 2e core ruleset favours certain types of approaches to others, especially in combat. The following changes attempt to create more viable combat options for all classes.

### Proficiency without level (official variant) ((++))

Often, characters find that they are pigeonholed to more narrow roles at higher levels due to proficiencies not keeping up with skill DC without investment. This variant aims to encourage characters to approach encounters using creative strategies outside their specific expertise, as long as they have at least **trained** proficiency.

### Minor skill feats (homebrew by me) ((++))

Some skill feats are more niche than others. To encourage players to experiment with different options, some skill feats have the tag **minor** added to them. Minor skill feats are granted in addition to regular skill feats as rewards for solving encounters and leveling up. A character can retrain one minor skill feat per full rest.

### Cantrip balance (homebrew by AJ Neuro) ((++))

Electric arc outperforms all other cantrips damage-wise by a large margin. To make other cantrips more attractive options, the cantrip rebalance designed by AJ Neuro is integrated into Pathfinder 2E redux.

### Incapacitate tag changes (homebrew by me) ((++))

Monsters are divided to three threat levels: mooks, at-levels and bosses. This three-tier system affects spell DC in a manner similar to incapacitate, protecting characters and monsters alike from debilitating effects from lower level adversaries, while making them more vulnerable to effects from higher-level adversaries.

|
### Control spell balance (homebrew by me) ((++))

Single target control spells are too situational to be used, unless they are powerful enough to shut down encounters. To avoid this save-or-die dichotomy, all single target control spells are transformed into multi-target or AoE spells, which follow these guidelines: control spells costing **1 action** cast at half-monster level should moderately debilitate numerous mooks regardless of weaknesses. **2 action** control spells should moderately debilitate a couple of at-level threats, when targetting weaknesses. Minor effect if not targetting weakness. **2 action** control spells should have minor but reliable effect on bosses, when targetting weaknesses.

### Stamina and resolve points (official variant + homebrew by me) ((++))

Each combat encounter in pathfinder 2e is designed to be a major threat to the party. This mandates healing up for every fight, which usually takes up hours of in-game time. This can break the narrative pacing of the campaign. To address this problem, the stamina and resolve point variant is used for both monsters and players. Monsters enter a **bloodied** condition when they lose all their stamina points, a mechanic borrowed from 4e. The **bloodied** condition can cause a variety of buffs and debuffs depending on the monster. Characters must choose carefully whether to burst down monsters to their bloodied state quickly or debilitate them and avoid triggering their bloodied condition until later in the fight.

### Automatic bonus progression (official variant + homebrew by me) ((++))

In the core ruleset of pathfinder 2E, magic items, property runes especially, often act as math fixers instead of offering unique and flavourful advantages. Using the automatic bonus progression variant rules game masters can focus on granting 'sidegrade' type magic items as rewards without players feeling that they fall behind monsters in combat strength.

### Math fixes (Homebrew by others and me) ((++))

To make some of the weaker character fantasies more attractive, math fixes to class feats and traits are made with the goal of having the combat efficiency of each character archetype within 30% of others. This is accomplished using a 2-step approach. First identify the design goals of Paizo and the wishes of the player-base and where some of the current character archetypes fall short. Then use combat simulations to make math fixes to these issues.

## Formatting ((Formatting))
There are a lot of ways to format your text. All of the different ways to use fancy formatting can be accessed in the menu with the pencil icon.
-
)

It's tough to write a lot of text when I don't really have anything to write about, but it's all for a good cause.

info (
## Columns ((+Columns))
Often you'll want to use two columns in order to shape the text in a more compact way. This makes it easier to parse and less overwhelming to the reader.
## Info Box ((+Info Box))
This is an info box that has white text on a red background. Just thought I should let you know.
)

This is another plain paragraph that exists. That's right. This is a bunch of letters arranged into what are known as words.

rules (
# Something about Rules ((+Rules))
Rules are very important and are a staple of any game. Always remember to include rules in the game, and this box will be useful for pointing out reminders about those rules.
)

Wow this text just keeps on going doesn't it. More help on using markdown can be found in the help button in the menu on the top left.

## Content Header ((+Content Header))

This is what the headers look like in just the normal content area.

### Smaller Header ((+Smaller Header))

This header is even smaller, but it is still trying its best and that should be enough.

### Another Small One

Even though they are small they are great in number which makes them just as intimidating as other headers.

|

note (
# This is a fancy note. ((+Note Box))
Sometimes when there is a bunch of text it's useful to put it into different areas around the page. Maybe someone doesn't need to read this right away but it would be useful to look at after they are finished reading other text. Or maybe they'll just read it first. Who knows!
## Secondary Header
Be sure to check out what each header level has to offer in each context. There aren't styles for every header one through six, but there are usually a couple for each context.
)

Well here we are again. This is some normal text that I want to type out in order to make this look more interesting. I think I'm really finding a good groove here. Writing this paragraph has been a lot easier than the ones before. You can tell by how long it's getting. The next box is usually used for math.

math (
Pizza Modifier = modifier of the dough's key taste score + cheese bonus + other bonuses + penalties
)

When finalizing the pizza modifier value it's important to remember that each topping will change the modifier based on the pizza topping table.

##### Table 1-1: Pizza Modifiers ((+Tables))
Pizza Topping | Modifier
--- | :---:
Onion | +1
Mushroom | +1
Pepperoni | +2
Sausage | +2
Garlic | +3
Pineapple | ?
. * Pineapple is too divisive to have an assigned value.

# Column Break ((+Column Break))

You can end a section of multiple columns with the forward slash character on its own line.

=

left (
# Left Sidebar ((+Left Sidebar))
Sometimes splitting the page with a sidebar that is about one third of the page wide is necessary.

## Why Though
It isn't known why this practice is so widely used. At some point in history the rule of thirds was discovered and ever since then the number three has been too powerful.

### Another Header
Sometimes the headers should look like this.
)

# Look at This

This section is good. Look at it. Look at all the words that are here. Here you can find many words

## Even More Words

One might think why not just use one of those text generators? That is a good question. One that will be answered in due time.

### Specific Words

It is believed that sometimes using words can be an effective form of communication, and furthermore precisely presenting those words in a coherent manner can be beneficial in maintaining clear intent from which those words arise.

right (
# Right Sidebar ((+Right Sidebar))
Sometimes splitting the page with a sidebar that is about one third of the page wide is necessary.

## Why Though
It isn't known why this practice is so widely used. At some point in history the rule of thirds was discovered and ever since then the number three has been too powerful.

### Another Header
Sometimes the headers should look like this.

* Sometimes you want a longer paragraph that is about a class and it should have a hanging indent, but this isn't always true so that's why it's a bullet point option.

# Look at This

This section is good. Look at it. Look at all the words that are here. Here you can find many words

info (
## Something

One might think why not just use one of those text generators? That is a good question. One that will be answered in due time.

|

## Columns

Boy howdy, columns can even be used in here, but you should be careful with them.
)

## More Text 4th

Notice how when using a header followed by a number with a suffix like 'th' it's automatically adjusted to be on the other side of the header. Neat! I think it's neat, anyway.

Uh oh, it appears that I need a little bit more text here in order to really fill out this spot. What a pickle I've gotten myself into. At least I can rest easy that nobody will actually ever read this.

#### 1st Level ((+Feat Section))

item(
# Something Cool :a: ((+Feats))
## Feat 3
-
; uncommon,class,feat,trait
**Usage** Typed into the editor window.
-
This feat allows you to type text into the editor and have it appear here. When starting a line with bold text make sure to put two line breaks between so the hanging indent functions properly.

**Critical Success** You are the best.

**Success** You are pretty good.

**Failure** At least you tried.

**Critical Failure** Even though your body and spirit are broken, you will heal with time.
)

|
#### 20th Level

item(
# Look out behind you :r:
## Feat 6
-
; rare,class,feat,trait
**Usage** Typed into the editor window.

**Trigger** You spaced things properly in the item window for the formatting to work.
-
You can put action symbols into here. Look here is a single action :a: wow. And then here's :aa: two actions. Now look out because we're going to :aaa: three actions. How about a :r: reaction? That is a :f: free action!

**Special** This feat is very special. It is so special that it needs some text that says special at the end of it.
)

=

# Other Formatting ((+Other Formatting))
Some other stuff that is helpful to know I think.
/
## Text Style ((++Text Style))
Make sure to remember **how to bold text** and sometimes more importantly *how to italicize*.

## Links ((++Links))
You can also use [links](http://pf2.tools) if you so desire.

## Image ((++Images))
What about an image? Here we go!

## Item Headers ((++Item Headers))
Sometimes there are entries using the item format that look like this.

item (
# Jennifer Swordslasher
-
### lg female champion
)
What follows is a description of Jennifer.

# Is that Everything?
I hope this covers everything that you need to know. I'm sure there will be more features and things added to this as time goes on. If you have any requests send a message to **hi@pf2.tools** and don't be shy about it!

## Nothing Else
There's not much else to say. I'm just gonna type a little bit more to fill this out just a little bit. I hope that's alright.

### Other Tools
You want to check out other tools? Check out [the monster maker](http://monster.pf2.tools) or how about the [character sheet and campaign tracker](http://character.pf2.tools) or maybe just a simple [text formatter](http://template.pf2.tools).

### Advanced Options ((Advanced))
Only advanced users are able to use the most powerful features...
-
)

## Table of Contents ((+Table of Contents))
A table of contents will be automatically generated if there are any markdown headers that are labeled using double parentheses. Throughout this example are headers that employ this technique. Using the + character at the beginning of the label will indent the links depending on the amount of + characters used. This can organize the links for more clarity.

## Label Links ((+Labels))
Markdown links can point to the same labels that the table of contents uses. For example, [this link](#other-formatting) will return to the Other Formatting section.

## Custom CSS ((+CSS))
Custom styles can be defined in a css block. For example: *The example is only visible in the editor!*

css (
/* css styles go here! */
)

Fonts and colors can be reset to a basic style by inserting the word **reset** on the first line of a document. External assets and images can not be loaded through any css styles.

## Content Reference ((+References))
Blocks of content can be stored with a key, and then included in other portions of the document. For example:

specialfeat {
item (
# Title
## Feat 5
-
;rare,trait,example
**Requirements** You are really cool.
-
This text can be used elsewhere in the document because it's in the block labeled 'specialfeat' using curly braces. To try this out try editing the text in this feat, and watch it magically change in both spots.
)
}

To have the text reappear elsewhere, insert the key surrounded by double curly braces. For example:

{{specialfeat}}

## Hidden Content ((+Hidden Content))

A single line with only a % character will create a hidden section at the end of the document. Everything past the line with the % will not be rendered, but can be used to store content references. For example, the following reference is stored in the hidden area.

{{hiddencontent}}

### HTML Comments ((++HTML Comments))

You can also hide content in html comments, like so:

<!--
htmlcomment {
    This text is hidden in an html comment! Edit it to watch them all change at once.
}
-->

/
{{htmlcomment}}
|
{{htmlcomment}}
|
{{htmlcomment}}
/

=

## External References ((+External References))

Items created using http://monster.pf2.tools, http://template.pf2.tools, and other scribe entries can be included dynamically by inserting the url to the specific item. The referred item must be set to public in order to be included.
/
For example, the monster found [here](https://monster.pf2.tools/v/9wLXpxm1) can be included:

https://monster.pf2.tools/v/9wLXpxm1
|
In addition, the item found [here](http://template.pf2.tools/v/55582QvF) can be included:

http://template.pf2.tools/v/55582QvF

-

Finally, the scribe entry found [here](https://scribe.pf2.tools/v/wMqTjphx) can be included:

https://scribe.pf2.tools/v/wMqTjphx

Be careful including other scribe documents as styles applied from them could override previously set styles.
